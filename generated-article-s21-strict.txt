# Antminer S21 Pro Hashboard Not Detected

## What the Problem Means

The "Hashboard not detected" issue indicates a communication breakdown between the hashboard and the rest of the system. This can be caused by various factors, including ASIC chip problems, voltage issues, or damage to the PIC microcontroller. As a result, the system is unable to stabilize and operate the affected chain, leading to a loss of hashing power. If left unaddressed, the issue can lead to further system instability and potentially cause more damage. The problem is often characterized by error messages and a significant drop in performance, making it essential to identify and address the root cause to restore system functionality and prevent additional failures.

## Symptoms You May Observe

You may notice that one of the hashboards is not being detected by the miner. This can cause a complete chain failure, resulting in a significant drop in the miner's overall performance. The dashboard may show a hashrate of zero for the affected chain. You may also see error messages indicating a problem with the system's initialization. The miner may become unstable, restarting frequently or failing to operate at all. In some cases, the miner may appear to be functioning normally, but with reduced performance due to the failed hashboard. These symptoms can indicate a serious issue that requires attention to prevent further damage.

## Why This Happens

The "hashboard not detected" issue in Antminer S21 Pro miners is often caused by underlying hardware failures. These failures can be attributed to various factors, including electrical wear, power instability, and heat stress. Over time, the constant operation of the miner can lead to degradation of internal components, resulting in complete chain failure. Environmental factors, such as high humidity and dust, can also contribute to the deterioration of the miner's components. When these components fail, the hashboard may not be detected, leading to a significant decrease in the miner's performance. If left unaddressed, these issues can lead to further damage and potentially render the miner inoperable.

## What Happens If Ignored

If the "hashboard not detected" issue is ignored, the problem can progress and cause further damage to the miner. The failed chain can become unstable, leading to increased downtime and potentially affecting other components. As the issue persists, it can spread to other parts of the miner, causing wider failures and reducing the overall performance. The miner may experience intermittent shutdowns, errors, and decreased hash rates, making it less reliable and efficient. Ignoring the problem can ultimately lead to more severe and costly damage, making it essential to address the issue promptly to prevent further complications and ensure the miner's optimal operation.

## When Professional Repair Is Required

The "hashboard not detected" error typically indicates a complete chain failure, often caused by ASIC chip failure, voltage domain collapse, or damaged PIC microcontroller. Environmental factors like high humidity and dust can exacerbate the issue. Restarting the miner or updating firmware will not resolve the problem, as the issue lies in the hardware. In such cases, professional repair is required, as specialized expertise is needed to diagnose and fix the complex hardware failure. Ignoring the issue will result in continued downtime and potential further damage. It is essential to seek the help of a qualified professional to ensure proper repair and prevent any additional harm to the miner.
